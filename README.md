# Picture Management & AI-based Tagging Service

Service (exposing RESTful API) which provides a solution for managing user accounts, uploading and browsing pictures, leveraging AI for picture tagging and performing tag-based searches. The system integrates with three external AI services: **Imagga**, **Ximilar** and **Clarifai** to deliver robust picture tagging capabilities.

This was my final project for the *Advanced functional programming with Scala* elective course at FMI (https://github.com/scala-fmi/scala-fmi-2021/blob/master/project-instructions.md).

Got an `A` as a final grade for the course.
